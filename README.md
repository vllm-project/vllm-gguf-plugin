# vLLM GGUF Quantization Plugin

This plugin provides out-of-tree GGUF quantization support for vLLM after
in-tree support deprecation
([vllm-project/vllm#39583](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/39583)).

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- CUDA toolkit or ROCm toolkit

We recommend [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for package management. If you
don't have it installed:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### From Source

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-gguf-plugin
   cd vllm-gguf-plugin
   ```

2. If vLLM is not already installed, install it first:

   ```bash
   uv pip install vllm --torch-backend=auto
   ```

3. Build and install the plugin against the PyTorch installation used by
   vLLM:

   ```bash
   uv pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
   ```

   Disabling build isolation ensures that the CUDA extension is compiled
   against the same PyTorch installation used by vLLM at runtime.

## Development

After completing the editable source installation above, install and run the
development tooling:

```bash
uv pip install -e .[dev] --torch-backend=auto
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The same hooks also run in GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.

## Usage

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B-GGUF:Q8_0 --tokenizer Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

## Tested model coverage

The plugin uses vLLM's model implementations and a generic GGUF weight
adapter, so model compatibility is broader than a fixed allowlist. The models
below are covered by the repository's generation tests and are the best-known
starting points:

| Modality | Model family | Tested GGUF quantization |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Text | Qwen 2.5 | Q6_K |
| Text | Qwen 3 | Q8_0 |
| Text | Phi 3.5 | IQ4_XS |
| Text | GPT-2 | Q4_K_M |
| Text | StableLM | Q4_K_M |
| Text | Gemma 3 | Q4_0 |
| Text | OLMoE | Q4_0 |
| Vision-language | Gemma 3 | Q4_0 backbone with F16 projector |
| Image generation | Z-Image-Turbo | Q4_0 |
| Image generation | FLUX.2-klein | Q8_0 |

Other vLLM-supported architectures may work when their GGUF tensor names map
to the corresponding Hugging Face model. A model appearing in vLLM's general
supported-model list does not by itself guarantee GGUF compatibility. When
reporting an unsupported model, include the model repository, quantization,
plugin and vLLM versions, and the complete weight-mapping error.
